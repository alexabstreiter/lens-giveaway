# Lens Raffle
A raffle module for the lense protocol.

## Installation:
Run the following commands to deploy the contract (you need enough MATIC tokens in your account):
```commandline
truffle migrate --network matic
```

Install the node packages and start the client:

Please note that this client is for demonstration purposes only. Any social media app built on lens protocol can easily include our raffle module to support raffles for their users.
